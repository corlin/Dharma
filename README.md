## 🌌 Philosophy

**Dharma** (Sanskrit) signifies the eternal law of the cosmos, one's inherent duty, and the path to righteousness. It parallels the Taoist concept of "The Way," the Christian notion of "Redemption," and the metaphysical goal of transcending the cycle of Samsara.

In the modern context, Dharma is a map out of entropy. Our lives are often consumed by chaos, anxiety, and disorder. This system is designed to liberate you from this chaotic state through rigorous planning and execution.

**The Concept of "Xíng Jì" (行纪)**:
*   **Action (行)**: Enlightenment is found not in contemplation alone, but in the fire of action.
*   **Order (纪)**: Creating structure within the chaotic flow of time.

The system is built on 5 fundamental layers:

1.  **Excavate (The Past)**: Uncover your "Anti-Vision" (your personal hell) and excavate your true values through Socratic questioning and psychological archaeology.
2.  **Orient (The Future)**: Define your North Star. Structure your ambitions into a coherent Goal Pyramid (Decade → Year → Quarter → Week).
3.  **Execute (The Present)**: Enter "Monk Mode". High-intensity Deep Work sessions with flow state enforcement, distraction blocking, and binaural focus aids.
4.  **Feedback (The Loop)**: Cybernetic review. Analyze the gap between what you said you would do and what you actually did.
5.  **Evolve (The Identity)**: Gamified growth. Earn XP, level up your identity, and consolidate your new behaviors into permanent traits.
