# 第一部分思路


You’re probably going to quit your new years resolution.

And that’s okay. Most people do (studies show 80-90% failure rates) because most people don’t actually want to change on a deep, internal level. That is, they go about changing their life in the completely wrong way. They create a new years resolution because everyone else does – humans want to impress others more than they want to impress themselves... we create a superficial meaning out of status games – but they don’t meet the requirements for true change, which goes a lot deeper than convincing yourself you’re going to be more disciplined or productive this year.

I’m not here to talk down on you. I’ve quit 10 times more goals than I’ve set. I think that should be the case for most people. But the fact that people try to change their lives and utterly fail almost every time holds true. So much so that it’s a meme for the gym to be crowded during January and return back to normal in February.

However, as much as I think new years resolutions are stupid, it’s always wise to reflect on the life you hate so you can launch yourself toward something that much better, as we will discuss.

Human nature is a b*tch, and the worst feeling is when you make a promise to yourself and can’t help but break it. You start to feel helpless, and if you don’t know what you’re doing, you may continue the cycle for years on end: always wanting to change, but never being able to.

So whether you want to start the business, transform your body, or take the risk toward a more meaningful life without quitting after 2 weeks, I want to share 7 ideas you probably haven’t heard before on behavior change, psychology, and productivity so you can do just that in 2026.

This will be comprehensive.

This isn’t one of those letters that you read through and forget about.

This is something you will want to bookmark, take notes on, and set aside time to think about.

The protocol at the end – to dig deep into your psyche and uncover what you truly want in life – will take about a full day to complete, with effects that last far longer than that.

All I ask is that you dedicate your full attention to this. If you get bored skip to the next section and go back to fill in the blanks if you need to.

Let’s begin.

(I also turned this letter into a video if you would rather watch it)

### I – You aren’t where you want to be because you aren’t the person who would be there

When it comes to New Year’s resolutions, people only focus on one of the two requirements for success:

1. Changing your actions to make progress toward the goal (least important, second order)
2. Changing who you are so that your behavior naturally follows (most important, first order)

Most people set a surface-level goal, hype themselves up to remain disciplined for the first few weeks, then go back to their old ways without much struggle, because they were trying to build a great life on a rotting foundation.

If this doesn’t make sense, let’s run through an example.

Think of somebody successful. It can be a bodybuilder with a great physique, a founder/CEO worth hundreds of millions, or a charismatic dude who can chat up a group without a shred of anxiety entering his mind space.

Do you think the bodybuilder has to “grind” to eat healthy? Does the CEO have to discipline themselves to show up and lead the team? To you, it may seem like that on the surface, but the truth is that *they can’t see themselves living any other way.* The bodybuilder has to grind to eat **unhealthily**. The CEO has to force themself to lie in bed past their alarm clock, and they hate every second of it.

To some people, my own lifestyle seems a bit extreme and disciplined. To me, it’s natural, and I don’t say that to contrast it with any other kind of lifestyle. I simply enjoy living this way. When my mom tells me that I should take a break, go out, and have some fun... I hold my tongue from telling her, “If I weren’t having fun, why would I be doing what I’m doing?”

Do not take this next sentence lightly.

If you want a specific outcome in life, you must have the *lifestyle* that creates that outcome long before you reach it.

If someone says they want to lose 30 pounds, I often don’t believe them. Not because I don’t think they are capable, but because there are too many times when that same person says “they can’t wait until they’re done losing weight so they can start to enjoy life again.” I hate to break it to you, but if you don’t adopt the lifestyle that led to you losing the weight, for life, and find a *reason with a higher gravitational pull* than the one tying you to your previous ways, then you will go straight back to where you started, and you can unhappily say that you wasted the resource you will never get back: time.

When you truly change yourself, all of your habits that don’t move the needle toward your goal become disgusting, because you have a deep and profound awareness of what kind of life those actions compound into. You are okay with your current standards because you are not fully aware of what they are or what they lead to. We will discuss how to uncover this, but we need to build up to that.

You say you want to change. You say you want to “become financially free” and “get healthy,” but your actions show otherwise for a reason. And it goes a lot deeper than you think.

### II – You aren’t where you want to be because you don’t *want* to be there

> Trust only movement. Life happens at the level of events, not of words. Trust movement.
>
> – Alfred Adler

If you want to change who you are, you must understand *how the mind works* so that you can start to reprogram it.

The first step to understanding the mind is to understand that all behavior is goal-oriented. When you think about it, this is kinda obvious, but when we dig into it, most people don’t want to hear it.

You take a step forward because you want to reach a certain location.

You scratch your nose because you want to make the itch go away.

Those ones are clear, but most of the time, your goals are unconscious. You may not realize that when you sit on the couch in the middle of the day, you are trying to burn time before your next responsibility, as one simple example.

On an even more unconscious and complex level, you pursue goals that can harm you, but you justify your actions in a way that is socially acceptable and doesn’t make you seem like a loser.

As an example, if you can’t stop procrastinating your work, you may justify it with the fact that you “lack discipline,” but in reality, you are attempting to achieve a goal like you always are. In this case, that goal could be to *protect yourself from the judgment that comes from finishing and sharing your work.*

If you say you want to quit your dead-end job, but stay in it without any real reason, you may start to think you don’t have enough courage, or that you were never really a “risk taker,” but the truth is that you are pursuing the goal of safety, predictability, and an excuse to not look like a failure to everyone else in your life who also works a dead-end job.

The lesson here is that real change requires changing your goals.

I don’t mean *setting* some surface level goal *because the act of doing that serves an unconscious goal that is actually harming you*. That’s been ran through enough in the productivity space. I mean changing your *point of view.* Because that’s what a goal is. A goal is a projection into the future that acts as a lens of perception which allows you to notice information, ideas, and resources that aid in you achieving that goal.

Now let’s dig a bit deeper, because if you don’t understand this, it only becomes more difficult to get out.

### III – You aren’t where you want to be because you’re afraid to be there

> The important thing for you to remember is that it does not matter in the least how you got the idea or where it came from. You may never have met a professional hypnotist. You may never have been formally hypnotized. But if you have accepted an idea - from yourself, your teachers, your parents, friends, advertisements, from any other source - and further, if you are firmly convinced that idea is true, it has the same power over you as the hypnotist’s words have over the hypnotized subject.
>
> – Maxwell Maltz

Here’s how you’ve become who you are today, and how you will become who you will be tomorrow. This is the anatomy of identity:

1. You want to achieve a goal
2. You perceive reality through the lens of that goal
3. You only notice “important” information and ideas that allows you to achieve that goal (learning)
4. You act toward that goal and receive feedback that you are progressing toward it
5. You repeat that behavior until it becomes automatic and unconscious (conditioning)
6. That behavior becomes a part of who you think you are (”I am the type of person who...”)
7. You defend your identity to maintain psychological consistency
8. Your identity shapes new goals, restarting the cycle, and if that identity is disadvantageous toward a good life, this gets bad very quick

The unfortunate reality is that you must break the cycle between steps 6 and 7, but this process starts when you are a child.

You have the goal of survival.

You are dependent on your parents to teach you how to survive. You had to conform. And since the way most people teach is through reward and punishment, unless you adopt their beliefs and values, you will be punished. You don’t actually think for yourself until you see through this.

But your parents have also gone through this process throughout their entire lives. That’s where it can get dangerous. Your parents, unless they broke the pattern themselves, were conditioned by the culturally accepted ideas of success from the Industrial age. They also carry the best and worst conditioning from their parents and their parents’ parents.

To take it a layer deeper, once you fulfill your physical survival needs (which is quite easy to do in today’s world, you’re practically born into safety), you start to survive on the conceptual or ideological level. You may not try to protect and reproduce your body, but you absolutely protect and reproduce your mind. It’s not difficult to see the war of ideas on the internet, and the participants are individual and group identities.

When your body feels threatened, you go into fight or flight.

When your identity feels threatened, the same thing happens.

If you are heavily identified with a political ideology (by the process we talked about just before), you will feel threatened when someone challenges your beliefs. You literally feel the stress. You feel, emotionally, like you were just slapped in the face. Since most people don’t analyze their emotions for truth, you tend to get stuck in echo chambers and double down on claims that harm yourself and others.

If you were raised in a religious household, and did not think for yourself, you will fight and attack others who threaten your psychological safety within that little bubble.

The same thing happens when you unconsciously see yourself as a lawyer, a gamer, or somebody else who would not take the actions to achieve a better life.

### IV – The life you want lies within a specific level of mind

The mind evolves through predictable stages over time.

When you’re born, you’re like a little survival sponge that absorbs whatever beliefs you can (which are heavily dictated by your culture) so that you can feel safe and secure. And if you don’t be careful, your mind may crystalize and it may make it difficult to live a meaningful life.

This has been documented enough in models like Maslow’s Hierarchy, Greuter’s stages of ego development, and Spiral Dynamics, each building off of one another, but it’s also not difficult to observe in society.

I’ve talked about these many times, and synthesized them into my own [Human 3.0 model](https://letters.thedankoe.com/p/human-30-a-map-to-reach-the-top-1?lli=1), but here’s the 80/20 of the 9 stages of ego development as a refresher (because repetition helps reveal things you didn’t notice before, and there are new people reading these letters):

![img](1.assets/https%253A%252F%252Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%252Fpublic%252Fimages%252Fbefe4764-cb9d-4415-a39e-4ddfe4164106_1000x672.jpeg)



1. **Impulsive** — No separation between impulse and action. Black and white thinking. *I.e. A toddler hits when angry because the feeling and the behavior are the same thing.*
2. **Self-Protective** — The world is dangerous and you learn to look out for yourself. *I.e. A kid learns to hide report cards, lie about chores, and figure out what adults want to hear.*
3. **Conformist** — You are your group and its rules feel like reality itself. *I.e. Someone who genuinely cannot fathom why anyone would vote differently than their family or group.*
4. **Self-Aware** — You notice you have an inner life that doesn’t match the exterior. *I.e. Sitting in church and realizing you’re not sure you believe what everyone around you seems to believe, but not knowing what to do with that feeling yet.*
5. **Conscientious** — You build your own system of principles and hold yourself accountable to them. *I.e. Leaving your family’s religion after careful study and adopting a personal philosophy you can defend, or building a career plan with clear milestones because you believe the right effort yields the right results.*
6. **Individualist** — You see that your principles were shaped by context and start holding them more loosely. *I.e. Realizing your political views have more to do with where you grew up than objective truth, or noticing that your ambitious career goals were really about earning your father’s approval.*
7. **Strategist** — You work with systems while aware of your own involvement in them. *I.e. Leading an organization while actively questioning your own blind spots, or engaging in politics knowing your perspective is partial and shaped by bias you can’t fully see.*
8. **Construct-Aware** — You see all frameworks, including your identity, as useful fictions. *I.e. Holding your spiritual beliefs with metaphorically not literally, knowing the map is not the territory, or watching yourself play the role of “founder” or “thought leader” with a kind of gentle amusement.*
9. **Unitive** — Separation between self and life dissolves. *I.e. Work, rest, and play feel like the same thing. There’s no one left who needs to become something, just presence responding to what arises.*

For most people reading this, I would assume you hover between 4 and 8, which is a huge gap. Those closer to 8 are reading this are doing so to either learn something or pass time. Those closer to 4 are really looking for a change. You feel like you are meant for more, but you can’t make sense of everything yet, because there’s obviously a lot at play.

The good thing is, it doesn’t really matter what stage you are in, because moving through any of them follows a pattern.

### V – Intelligence is the ability to get what you want out of life

> The only real test of intelligence is if you get what you want out of life.
>
> – Naval Ravikant

There is a formula for success.

One ingredient is **agency**.

One ingredient is **opportunity** (which many people like to mistake as “privilege” - because they the other ingredients).

The last ingredient is **intelligence**.

If you have high agency but low opportunity, it doesn’t matter how likely you are to act toward a goal, because it isn’t a goal that will bear much fruit.

If you have opportunity and agency but low intelligence, then you will never be fully able to benefit from that opportunity.

First, we’ve talked about agency before here. In terms of opportunity, I can’t tell you to change your physical location, but if you don’t see the abundance of digital opportunity right in front of you, I don’t know what to tell you.

With that said, I want to focus on *what intelligence is* in the context of these two other ingredients and this letter.

> Cybernetics comes from the greek word *kybernetikos* which means “to steer” or “good at steering.”

It’s also known as “the art of getting what you want.”

So, if Naval’s definition of intelligence is getting what you want out of life, understanding cybernetics helps you do that much faster.

Cybernetics illustrates the properties of intelligent systems.

- To have a goal.
- Act toward that goal.
- Sense where you are.
- Compare it to the goal.
- And act again based on that feedback.

*You can judge intelligence based on the system’s ability to iterate and persist with trial and error.*

A ship blown off course that corrects toward its destination. A thermostat sensing a change in heat and turning on. The pancreas excreting insulin after blood glucose spikes.

What does this have to do with getting what you want out of life?

Everything.

Acting, sensing, comparing, and understanding the system from a meta-perspective is fundamental to high intelligence.

High intelligence is the ability to iterate, persist, and understand the big picture. **The mark of low intelligence is the inability to learn from your mistakes.**

Low-intelligence people get stuck on problems rather than solving them. They hit a roadblock and quit. Like a writer who fails to build a readership and quits because they lack the ability to try new things, experiment, and figure out a process that works for them (to think that there isn’t an effective process you can create is verifiably false, no matter your limiting beliefs, hence being low intelligence.)

High intelligence is realizing any problem can be solved on a large enough timescale. The reality is that you can achieve any goal you set your mind to. This isn’t something that can be disproven within reason.

Intelligence is realizing that *there is* a series of choices you can make which lead to achieving the goal you want. You understand that ideas are hierarchical and that you can’t go from papyrus to Google docs in one fell swoop. Even if that goal is impossible right now, you simply don’t have the resources – which may be invented over the next few years – to achieve that thing.

When I talk about “goals,” and as I will continue repeating, I am not speaking from the typical lens of self-help, although that’s a helpful lens to adopt at times.

我站在目的论或希腊的 *kosmos* 的视角上说话——万物皆有其*目的* 。万物都是更大整体的一部分。

Goals determine how you see the world.

Goals determine what you consider “success” or “failure.”

You can try to “enjoy the journey,” but if you pursue the wrong goal, you will not enjoy it.

Your mind is the operating system for reality.

That system is composed of goals.

For most people, those goals are assigned to them. Programmed like lines of code in your psyche.

*Go to school. Get the job. Get offended. Play victim. Retire at 65.*

A known path that doesn’t work.

To become more intelligent, you must:

- Reject the known path
- Dive into the unknown
- Set new, higher goals to expand your mind
- Embrace the chaos and allow for growth
- Study the generalized principles of nature
- Become a deep generalist

That leads us into the next section perfectly.

### VI – How to launch into a completely new life (in 1 day)

> The best periods of my life always came after a period of getting absolutely fed up with the lack of progress I was making.

How do you dig into your mind?

How do you become aware of your conditioning?

How do you reach profound insights and truths that change the trajectory of your life?

Through the simple, but often painful act of *questioning.*

Something that so few people do, and you can tell by how they speak or give their thoughts on a specific topic. Questioning is thinking, and very few people do it.

I want to give you a comprehensive protocol that you can use every year to reset your life and launch into a season of intense progress. This protocol helps you ask the right questions.

These questions will cover the macro to the micro: where you want to be, what you need to do to get there, and what you can do immediately to start moving the needle toward that reality.

This will require one full day to complete, so I recommend you follow along with the exact protocol. You will need a pen, paper, and an open mind.

When I observe patterns in people who successfully flip their identity, it happens fast after a build up of tension. Specifically, I’ve noticed 3 phases that people then to go through.

1. **Dissonance** – They feel like they don’t belong in their current life, and become sufficiently fed up with their lack of progress.
2. **Uncertainty** – They don’t know what comes next, so they either experiment or get lost and feel worse.
3. **Discovery** – They discover what they want to pursue and make 6 years of progress in 6 months.

So, our goal with this protocol is to help you reach the point of dissonance, navigate through uncertainty, and discover what it truly is that you want to achieve, so much so that the clarity is overwhelming and distractions no longer hold their weight.

This protocol is structured so that it can be completed in one day. In the morning, you do a psychological excavation to uncover your own hidden motives. During the day, you prompt yourself with interrupts to keep you out of autopilot and contemplate your life. At night, you synthesize the insights into a direction you will start to move in tomorrow.

I cannot guarantee that this will work for everyone, because I cannot guarantee that everyone reading this is in the right chapter of their own story that would make these points impactful. You can’t place the climax at the start of the book and expect it to be interesting.

**Part 1) Morning – Psychological Excavation – Vision & Anti-Vision**

First we must create a new frame, or lens of perception, for your mind to operate from.

This is like creating a new shell, leaving your old one, and slowly growing into it over time. It won’t feel like it fits at first. That’s a good thing.

Set aside 15-30 minutes (the length of one YouTube video... you can do it) to think about and answer these questions. Do not attempt to outsource this contemplation to AI. I want you to break past the limiter that is on your mind. If you can’t answer these immediately, come back to them later.

1. What is the dull and persistent dissatisfaction you’ve learned to live with? Not the deep suffering but what you’ve learned to tolerate. (If you don’t hate it, you will tolerate it)
2. What do you complain about repeatedly but never actually change? Write down the three complaints you’ve voiced most often in the past year.
3. For each complaint: What would someone who watched your behavior (not your words) conclude that you actually want?
4. What truth about your current life would be unbearable to admit to someone you deeply respect?

Those questions are meant to make you aware of the pain in your current life. Now, we need to turn those into what I call an “anti-vision,” which is a brutal awareness of the life you do not want to live. That way, you can use that negative energy to aim your efforts in a positive direction and act from a place of intrinsic motivation.

1. If absolutely nothing changes for the next five years, describe an average Tuesday. Where do you wake up? What does your body feel like? What’s the first thing you think about? Who’s around you? What do you do between 9am and 6pm? How do you feel at 10pm?
2. Now do it but for ten years. What have you missed? What opportunities closed? Who gave up on you? What do people say about you when you’re not in the room?
3. You’re at the end of your life. You lived the safe version. You never broke the pattern. What was the cost? What did you never let yourself feel, try, or become?
4. Who in your life is already living the future you just described? Someone five, ten, twenty years ahead on the same trajectory? What do you feel when you think about becoming them?
5. What identity would you have to give up to actually change? (”I am the type of person who...”) What would it cost you socially to no longer be that person?
6. What is the most embarrassing reason you haven’t changed? The one that makes you sound weak, scared, or lazy rather than reasonable?
7. If your current behavior is a form of self-protection, what exactly are you protecting? And what is that protection costing you?

If you answered those truthfully, and if you are in the right chapter of your life, you will feel a deep sense of dis-ease and possibly disgust for how you are currently living. Now, we need to orient that energy in a positive direction. We need to create a minimum viable vision, because your vision is like a product. It starts out unclear, but with time and experience, it grows stronger and more potent.

1. Forget practicality for a minute. If you could snap your fingers and be living a different life in three years, not what’s realistic, what you actually *want*? What does an average Tuesday look like? Same level of detail as question 5.
2. What would you have to believe about yourself for that life to feel natural rather than forced? Write the identity statement: “I am the type of person who...”
3. What is one thing you would do this week if you were already that person?

Answer all of those first thing in the morning tomorrow.

**Part 2) Throughout The Day – Interrupting Autopilot – Breaking Unconscious Patterns**

These journaling exercises are cute, but we want real change.

Frankly, that’s not going to happen if you don’t break the current unconscious patterns that are keeping you the same.

Throughout the day, I want you to contemplate on everything you journaled in part one. Beyond that, I don’t want you to forget to contemplate. Please take this seriously. You aren’t going to change by doing the same thing for the rest of your life. You need to consciously force a pattern break.

Take the time right now to create reminders or calendar events in your phone. Include the question in the reminder or event so that you can immediately start thinking about it.

The more random and non-conflicting with your schedule there are, the better.

- **11:00am:** What am I avoiding right now by doing what I’m doing?
- **1:30pm:** If someone filmed the last two hours, what would they conclude I want from my life?
- **3:15pm:** Am I moving toward the life I hate or the life I want?
- **5:00pm:** What’s the most important thing I’m pretending isn’t important?
- **7:30pm:** What did I do today out of identity protection rather than genuine desire? (Hint: it’s most things you do)
- **9:00pm:** When did I feel most alive today? When did I feel most dead?

To add a bit more fuel to the fire, schedule these questions during times where you are either commuting, walking, or lying around.

- What would change if I stopped needing people to see me as [the identity you wrote in question 10]?
- Where in my life am I trading aliveness for safety?
- What’s the smallest version of the person I want to become that I could be tomorrow?

**Part 3) Evening – Synthesizing Insight – Entering A Season Of Progress**

If you followed that process, I would be surprised if you didn’t have at least *one* profound insight that could alter the course of your life. Now, we need to make those known, integrate them into who we are, and act on them to begin solidifying our journey to a new level of mind.

1. After today, what feels most true about why you’ve been stuck?
2. What is the actual enemy? Name it clearly. Not circumstances. Not other people. The internal pattern or belief that has been running the show.
3. Write a single sentence that captures what you refuse to let your life become. This is your anti-vision compressed. It should make you feel something when you read it.
4. Write a single sentence that captures what you’re building toward, knowing it will evolve. This is your vision MVP.

Lastly, we need to create goals.

Again, these aren’t goals that you set for the sake of achievement, because goals are just projections. They are unreliable and make you feel bound to something that will inevitably change. Instead, think of goals as a point of view. A lens that you can exchange to enter the right state of mind to perform the action that will lead away from the life you don’t want. Do not worry about some kind of finish line, because as we will find, it doesn’t exist. Enjoyment is found in progress.

1. **One-year lens:** What would have to be true in one year for you to know you’ve broken the old pattern? One concrete thing.
2. **One-month lens:** What would have to be true in one month for the one-year lens to remain possible?
3. **Daily lens:** What are 2-3 actions you can timeblock tomorrow that the person you’re becoming would simply do?

That was a lot.

Hopefully it was helpful.

But we have one last piece to lock it all in.

Stick with me.

### VII – Turn Your Life Into A Video Game

> The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy—or attention—is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else.
>
> – Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

You now have all of the components that lead to a good life.

Now, it may be helpful to organize all of your insights into one coherent plan. Pull out a new page and write down these 6 components:

- **Anti-vision** – What is the bane of my existence, or the life I never want to experience again?
- **Vision** – What is the ideal life that I think I want and can improve as I work toward it?
- **1 year goal** – What will my life look like in 1 year time, and is that closer to the life I want?
- **1 month project** – What do I need to learn? What skills do I need to acquire? What can I build that will move me closer to the one year goal?
- **Daily levers** – What are the priority, needle-moving tasks that bring my project closer to completion?
- **Constraints** – What am I not willing to sacrifice to achieve my vision from the ground up?

Why is this so powerful?

Because these components literally create your own little world. If you are meant to pursue this hierarchy of goals at this stage of your life, you will have no other option but to become obsessed. You will feel the pull to something greater. You will not see anything else as an option.

You turn your life into a video game.

Because games are the poster child for obsession, enjoyment, and flow states. They have all the components that lead to focus and clarity, so if we reverse engineer what those components are, we can live in a state of deeper enjoyment, less distractions, and more success.

Your vision is how you **win**. At least until the game evolves.

Your anti-vision is what’s at **stake**. What happens if you lose or give up.

Your 1 year goal is the **mission**. This is your sole priority in life.

Your 1 month project is the **boss fight**. How you gain XP and acquire loot.

Your daily levers are the **quests**. The daily process that unlocks new opportunities.

Your constraints are the **rules**. The limitations that encourage creativity.

All of these act as a concentric set of circles, like a forcefield, that guard your mind from distractions and shiny objects.

The more you play the game, the stronger this force becomes, and soon enough it becomes who you are, and you wouldn’t have it any other way.

# 第二部分思路

How to fix your entire life in 1 hour

You haven't experienced anything near what you're capable of.

And if you learn how to unlock that power, you can do what most people consider impossible.

Unfortunately, most people have the idea of success completely backward.

They think they need to grind for 12 hours a day like their favorite entrepreneur to see any form of result.

The reality is, you have responsibilities. I get it. Some of you can't just magically scrape back time. You may have a job, kids, spouse. Those things are important. Meaning, you probably have **one hour** a day you can put toward a better future.

And that's a great thing, because *you can drastically change your life in 365 hours.*

One hour a day.

One meaningful project.

One vision for your future.

If you can spend 8 hours building someone else's dreams, you can spend 1 hour building your own.

You don't need more time. You need a deep sense of clarity that allows you to make the most of the time you currently have. And you need to *feel like your efforts are making a difference in your life.*

A pattern I’ve noticed in successful creatives and CEOs - that didn’t sacrifice their life for success - is that they physically worked very little, yet people see them as hard workers. Mentally, they were always thinking, plotting, and scheming. They worked in their mind. And once they were clear on their idea, they executed with speed that others couldn’t compete with.

Productivity is like fitness, and you wouldn't train 8 hours a day with no food or sleep and expect to make progress. The same applies to the mind.

With that, there are 3 types of work:

1. **Building** – *Intense* bursts of deep work to bring a project to life, like a product, service, or brand.
2. **Maintenance** – *Consistent* and often repetitive work that you've systemized to keep what you built alive, like marketing or customer service.
3. **Recovery** – *Subconscious* work that almost everyone ignores. The rest, leisure, and lack of narrow focused stress that allows breakthrough ideas to form the future of your work.

Your goal, then, is to *build* for one hour a day until you are able to pursue what you want full time. *Then* you start to think about transitioning into maintenance work.

But what do you build?

How do you pierce through the distractions and inner voice that seems to be your enemy?

Where do you find a never ending source of motivation to show up every day?

The answers to those questions determine much of your life.

I have 6 ideas to share with you on deep productivity. Not just "sit down and do the work" because that's been ran through enough and obviously hasn't fixed everyone's problems. You need understanding. We need to dissect the psychology of focus, how distractions work, and finally a protocol you can use to make your one hour a day count.

This is part 2 of the last article that seemed to break X - sorry Elon.

This one will be just as comprehensive. A complete productivity masterclass so you can get 10 books worth of knowledge from one article.

My hope is that I leave you with no option but to feel clear on what you want out of life and how to get it.

Because of that, this will be long. All I ask is that you dedicate your full attention. If you don't have the time, bookmark it and come back to it.

Let's begin.

## I – Why it's so hard to sit down and do the work

> The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is order in consciousness. This happens when psychic energy—or attention—is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action. The pursuit of a goal brings order in awareness because a person must concentrate attention on the task at hand and momentarily forget everything else.  – Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi

Your mind is a supercomputer running the game of life.

Your attention (an incredibly scarce resource), is the RAM.

RAM, for the non-technical, means "random access memory." It determines the performance of the computer.

The more programs and browser tabs you have open, the slower your computer will be. The mind works the same way, but there's one major caveat... you have a threshold for how much your mind can process.

Humans can process around 50 bits of conscious information per second. The unconscious mind can *manage* about 11 million bits per second (this is for things like walking, sensing, accessing stored habits or patterns), but that's aside the point.

In other words, when you add it up, you have about 125 billion bits of information to "use up" in your lifetime. That's it. *That's your potential*. Every single thing you give your attention lowers that number by a small amount. That should terrify you.

Sadly, most people live with multiple high-demand programs running at the same time. It's no wonder they can't focus. Their attention is split between thoughts about regretful past mistakes, thoughts about stressful future tasks, desires for pleasure and entertainment to escape those, and open loops of tasks they were supposed to complete but forgot about (I'm looking at you dudes who forgot to take out the trash).

The list of distractions goes on, and that's the danger.

If you understand entropy, you understand that by doing nothing with your life, it only becomes more chaotic and overwhelming.

You don't stay the same.

You dig yourself deeper into a rut without trying.

The good life demands consistent effort toward *your own* goals. You know the feeling. When everything aligns and you enter a blur of fulfilling work. I want to show you how to replicate it.

Entropy, for those wondering, is one of the most fundamental principles in physics. The simple version is that there are vastly more ways for things to be disorganized than organized, so systems naturally tend toward messier and often more chaotic states. Energy needs to be put into keeping things ordered.

As an everyday example, if you don't put energy into maintaining your bookshelf, books will end up all over your house, at your friend's house, and in places you didn't think they could end up. *The longer you go without organizing your shelf, the more effort it will take when you finally decide to.*

Further, if you don't put effort into cleaning your room, it will slowly get messier and messier until you're late for work because your good socks are under a pizza box from last week.

Psychic entropy (or the mind tending toward disorder) can then be a useful metaphor to view focus and distractions through. This can be useful for creativity, as we will learn when we talk about a better type of routine, but when it comes to focused work, it's obvious why you can't laser in on one thing.

You aren't productive because you don't have clarity.

You don't have clarity because you allow your attention to drift toward one distraction, and before you know it, your mind is like the end of a frat party. People passed out everywhere and you don't even know where to start cleaning.

The good thing is that the solution is simple, but powerful.

## II – How to unlock insane focus on command

*Clarity, importance, and urgency.*

Those are the critical ingredients that prevent distractions from penetrating your mind. Those are the requirements needed for *deep* focused work.

- To gain clarity, you need to choose a task that is challenging enough to be *novel.*
- If that task overwhelms you, you need to break the task down into sub-goals that *you do have clarity on.* Then, you execute and acquire the skill that allows you to continue moving to the main task.
- For you to find something important, you need to fully understand (1) where your life will end up without achieving the goal and (2) what your potential could be if you achieved the goal.

Urgency is what gets you to sit down and work right now rather than later, but we’ll discuss the exact protocol for all of this in a few paragraphs.

The simplest formula for reaching the flow state, or the most optimal state of experience, is to ensure that the challenge you are taking on is just barely above your skill level.

Because think about it.

If the challenge of a goal is too high for your skill level, you get anxious. If the challenge is too low, you get bored. In a video game, you wouldn't fight a level 100 character when you are a level 1. It wouldn't be fun, obviously.

Imagine you're at a job. The work is repetitive and doesn't challenge you in the slightest. You get **bored**, and that boredom leads to self-centeredness. *Your focus breaks and you start to think of better things you could be doing.*

Now imagine you're forced to speak in front of a thousand people. You haven't practiced before. It's overwhelming, so you become **anxious**. That anxiety leads to self-consciousness. Your focus turns inward and *negative thoughts flood your mind about how you aren't good enough.*

But these aren't always a bad thing.

They are only the enemies when you are trying to focus. And that's just it... People aren't focused on the tasks that will actually create the life they want. They get stuck in "doing mode" (a narrow state of stress that prevents you from registering ideas or opportunities that could change your life) and feel like they are worthless if they aren't being productive, because society has convinced them that productivity is the highest value.

Boredom, in fact, can be a gateway to novelty.

Anxiety can very well be the chaos you need for ultimate creativity.

Your inability to sit in a room alone is likely the source of most of your problems.

So what's missing?

The answer lies in the fact that everyone works *too much.*

## III – The routines of highly successful creatives

> Fill your brain in the afternoons with books, learning, and socialization Empty your brain before bed with journaling, planning, and meditation Use your brain in the morning with creation, output, and focus

I’ve always had some form of aversion toward Western work culture.

- 80-hour work weeks
- High-pressure environments
- Little time for rest and recovery

It never seemed “right” to me. It was mechanical. Robotic. Soulless. Why would I work on something I dislike, for people I dislike, knowing that my actions don't contribute to *my* future? Because if they did, I wouldn't have a problem working, because it wouldn't feel like work.

Most people wear overwork as a badge of honor.

But the artists, creatives, and visionaries we *actually remember* aren't participating in that imaginary race.

The ancient Greeks, as an example, saw rest as a gift. It was the pinnacle of civilized life. Almost every ancient society recognized that *both* work and rest were necessary for a good life. One provided the means to live, the other gave meaning to life. It wasn't until industrialization that 9-5 jobs even became a thing, and now we can't imagine our lives any other way. Before that, most people were self-employed farmers and artisans. They *directed their own work,* which is going to be a critical decision one must make as AI continues to accelerate the automation of jobs.

When we reverse engineer the lifestyles of highly successful creatives, we see the same pattern.

They didn't grind 16 hours a day (well, sometimes they did, but it was because they chose to, not because they were forced to, massive difference).

In fact, most of their time was spent in leisure, yet they contributed some of the most important ideas to society that have impacted our lives today. They lounged by the pool, played tennis, or paced the grounds of the Apple campus because they were one of the few people who realized what happens in the brain while at rest. That's when their best "work" was done.

(By the way, when I say "rest," I don't mean bubblebaths and wine. Most people use cheap pleasures as an escape from the life they hate and call it rest.)

*Rest occurs when focus shifts inward.*

When you stop focusing on external tasks, your brain automatically shifts into the Default Mode Network, which connects regions of the brain associated with visual thinking and creativity.

The interesting thing is, our brains don't use much less energy in this mode. Meaning, *while you are at rest, your brain is still at work, and it is working quite hard*. This is the secret of successful creatives. They *take* their rest, because society isn't going to give it to them, and their brain lights up with ideas that they can quickly jot down. Then, when it's time for a deep focus session, they bring those ideas to life by applying them to a meaningful project that leads to the future they desire.

With that, the best daily routine does not come from the latest podcast you listened to. It comes from 3 activities.

- **One that fills your mind** – you need education, ideas, and novel resources you can apply toward your goals. This leads to intrinsic motivation.
- **One that empties your mind** – you don’t want to be trapped in a chaotic bubble of thoughts and useful ideas. That’s exactly how you make zero progress. Write things down.
- **One that uses your mind** – you need a vessel to focus your efforts. A project. A business. Something of your own that you can apply your education and ideas to.

We will discuss the last one so you can get into a state of deep focused work, but for now, you have my permission to rest, because that is what makes your work impactful.

Go on a walk.

Drive up to the woods for a day.

Pull out a notebook and imagine a better future.

Of course, this all sounds cute, but it still doesn't help the people who don't know what to do. And it especially doesn't help the people who don't have the motivation to step into a new life.

## IV – You need to be extreme if you want your life to change

There are a few moments in my life that I remember vividly.

They always followed the same pattern.

First, I felt a sense of tension with the lack of progress I was making. I knew something had to change.

Second, that tension became unbearable. I knew that I was letting my future self down.

Third, I disappeared. I started over from scratch. My life seemingly flipped in an instant and I entered a season of deep obsession towards a goal.

I wanted to understand this process, so I went looking. Here's what I found.

**1) Being extreme changes your brain**

"Neurons that fire together, wire together."

That's Hebb's Law, a famous saying that summarizes a neuropsychological theory related to neuroplasticity.

Neuroplasticity, as you may know, is your brain's ability to rewire itself by forming new neural connections throughout life. Your brain isn't fixed and rigid. It can adapt, learn, and change based on your experiences, thoughts, and actions.

Being extreme about changing your life helps quicken this process.

People scream about how "consistency is key," which is true due to repetition reinforcing neural pathways through consistent effort, but we can take it a step further.

Novelty and challenge stimulate neuroplasticity even more.

So, when you flip the switch and pursue a goal with all your might, you put your brain in an environment that quickly adapts and helps that become your *new standard.*

**2) Intensity and obsession create a neurochemical cocktail**

Most people fall into a rut because they seek *extrinsic motivators.*

But when you're obsessed in the context of this discussion, you are fueled by *intrinsic motivators.*

Each of which stacks onto and strengthens each other in a way that sustains some degree of flow (optimal experience, or one of the most enjoyable states of mind):

1. **Curiosity** – The desire to explore the unknown, learn how to change, and fill knowledge gaps. Results in good dopamine from novelty and norepinephrine which heightens attention preparing you to learn.
2. **Passion** – An intense enthusiasm is built for the path that allows you to change your life. Results in more good dopamine and norepinephrine.
3. **Purpose** – The feeling that your actions contribute to something larger than yourself. Achieving goals results in more dopamine which reinforces behavior. Serotonin stems from significance and belonging. Oxytocin stems from connection.
4. **Autonomy** – The desire to direct your own life and work. To control your choices, actions, and environment. Results in yet again more dopamine and a reduction in cortisol (the stress from feeling put in a box), allowing for creative decision making.
5. **Mastery** – The process of learning and growing is its own reward. Results in sustainable good dopamine that keeps you in the game.

You start with curiosity and experimentation until you find one thing that pulls you deeper.

You *become* passionate in the goal once enough effort is invested. You don't just choose your passion.

You attach that passion to something greater than yourself – a purpose.

You break off the default path and acquire the skill to be autonomous and direct your own work, often through entrepreneurship.

You shift from shallow reasoning (making money, etc) to a philosophical sense of mastery, allowing you to stay in the game.

You will understand how all of these come into play when we incorporate them into a daily focused work block.

**3) Your mind filters reality based on what you're obsessed with**

> The man who conceives himself to be a "failure-type person" will find some way to fail, in spite of all his good intentions, or his willpower, even if opportunity is literally dumped in his lap. The person who conceives himself to be a victim of injustice, one "who was meant to suffer," will invariably find circumstances to verify his opinions. – Maxwell Maltz

Your brain operates on a salience network.

Meaning, whatever provides the most dopamine becomes the most important.

For our ancestors, their sole goal was sex and survival. That was what was important to them. Their minds were biased toward noticing scarce resources, such as fat, sugar, or salt.

In today's world, corporations and social media companies have hijacked this part of our brain. *Digital fat, sugar, and salt*. They've studied how this mechanism works endlessly and have weaponized it to keep you on their platform.

This has led to the cheap dopamine epidemic we find ourselves in.

Our brain used to point out resources that would allow us to survive and thrive, but now there are so many distractions that we get trapped in this overwhelming bubble of nothingness. Our lives only become substantially worse unless we rip the band-aid off and laser in on a goal we choose for ourselves.

Then, when you are obsessed with that goal, your mind starts to heal, and your newfound curiosity will guide you toward the knowledge, skills, and actions required for your unique form of success.

That leads us into how to structure your life to maximize this effect.

## V – The deep work routine that changed my life

You need a routine.

And if you think you don’t, you may not realize that you already have a routine that *you* didn't create. Your parents, teachers, employers, and society did.

Or your “routine” is not having a routine, which is still a routine.

But we don't just want any old routine.

We want to ensure that what you are working on moves the needle toward the life you want.

Especially if you only have one hour to spare.

The protocol below will help you determine what is worth that one hour of your time.

Other than that, I would highly encourage you to take intentional rest throughout your days.

Personally, I structure my days as a priority ladder.

I write first thing in the morning, as that is my highest leverage task. In my businesses, I'm the distribution guy. The success of the company is dependent on how well my writing does. 1 post can reach millions, which is an absurd amount of leverage (of course, that doesn't happen every time).

For other people, especially if they haven't started on their own path, building the product could be the most important task to spend their one hour on. Then, once it's built (remember that there are 3 types of work - building, maintenance, recovery), they can start to shift their priorities around.

I tend to structure my work blocks in two ways - productivity blocks and creativity blocks. Two completely different modes of focus. One narrow one open.

I work on the highest priority task for block one, first thing in the morning, then I go on a walk as a creativity block (remember the Default Mode Network in the brain). On that walk, sometimes I read, sometimes I think, other times I try to solve a problem. Then I repeat the process for a few more rounds until that day's work is done. That acts as a hard stop for thinking about work, allowing my mind to do what it does best.

With that out of the way, here's the protocol to launch into a season of intense progress toward your goals.

**1) Vision & Anti Vision**

Become brutally aware of 2 things:

- What you don't want
- Where you will end up if you keep taking the same actions

Observe the masses and see where mindless action leads. It's not pretty. Sit with your thoughts here. It's easier to know what you don't want (from experience) than what you want (from imagination).

So, create an anti-vision for your future.

Sit with a notebook and get specific.

Write out every single thing that you don't want and why. You should feel this deep sense of discomfort start to do it. Do not stop writing until you feel this.

With that discomfort, get petty. Like *really* petty. Write down exactly what your life would look like if you were able to create it from scratch. Think of the big goals you've always thought of achieving but set on the bookshelf because they aren't "rational."

If your friends and family think you wouldn't achieve these goals, even better.

In that same notebook from above, write out exactly what you are going to do to achieve those things. Write down every little thing you will need to learn. From the top down - your ideal future to the exact step you must take - map out what needs to be done.

The last thing you are going to write down is all of the potential distractions standing in the way of the life you want.

Success is less about being disciplined and more about removing the distractions that make discipline difficult.

Next, disappear.

Not from life, but from what is binding you to your old ways.

These can be people, games, apps. It's easier to remove everything at once and deal with the pain than it is to tell everyone your plans (and listen to their crab-in-a-bucket opinions).

In other words, break your addiction with feeling horrible.

Usually due to giving time and energy to people, activities, and things that don't care for your well-being.

You don't need to explain yourself.

**2) Create A Hierarchy Of Goals**

The mind craves order.

You need to create a new mental frame that you can tap into at anytime. And remember, you need to put energy into the system that will create the life you want, or else your mind will slowly become more disordered and chaotic, whether you like it or not.

That's what we're doing here.

We're creating an impenetrable frame.

We aren't setting goals in hopes that we achieve them.

Big goals are for *direction.* Small goals are for *clarity.* You are simply making an educated guess at the path you need to take. When it comes to actually moving along that path, you will need to adapt in real time, which is what we will learn last.

You don't need endless motivation when the task in front of you is so stupidly simple that you can't help but complete it.

Break down your vision into small pieces.

Create a 10-year goal.

Then a 1-year goal.

Then a 1-month goal.

Then a 1-week goal.

But now we need something worth working on. That is arguably the missing piece from most people's lives.

**3) Project-Based Learning**

You know what you don't want out of life.

You have an idea of what you want out of life.

Now you need to acquire the *skills* and *knowledge* that bridge the gap between both.

How do you slowly start moving into the unknown by having a way to order any potential chaos along the way?

*Personal projects*.

The best way to learn is to build a real-world project and only search for information when you need it. How much you learn is directly correlated with how much progress you make on the project.

When you watch endless tutorials, you fill your mind with noise. Most of that information goes to waste. It leads to overwhelm, anxiety, and slows down how fast you learn. When it comes time to actually build the project, you feel as if you learned nothing, because you still don't know what to do. Endless consumption creates endless options. We don't want that.

As an example, it is rare that people just learn Photoshop from watching tutorials. They have an image they want to create. They try and fail, and from that failure, they have something *specific* to learn that can be *directly* applied. No knowledge goes to waste. You try, fail, and search for the information you need right when you need it.

For those wondering, a "project" can be anything. Your health can be a project. Your business can be a project. A project is simply a structured way of achieving a goal, or making progress toward a goal.

The bridge between where you are and where you want to be is a series of projects that reflect the value you've developed in yourself. If you'd like, you can turn that project into a product, because you've solved a problem in your own life and can now help others do the same. A quality project is the only qualification you need to start a business nowadays, or even get hired by posting about it online, which is an incredible thing considering it is one of the last options to take once everything is automated out of existence.

**Here's how you start:**

Choose something to build that moves the needle toward what you want in life. Think of it as a traditional goal, but a project turns that goal into a system. Create a note and brain dump everything that comes to mind. Save 3-5 sources of inspiration you want to emulate. Study those sources and break down their structure. Outline the project into sections, milestones, and what you need to learn.

Now that you're ready to start, don't start learning. Start with what you know.

Learning comes from struggle, not memorization. Start the project. Let it expose the gaps in your knowledge. Try to figure it out. Search for the answer when your mind is most likely to remember it.

**4) Lever Moving Tasks**

Every single day, complete at least 1-3 priority tasks that move the needle toward completing the project.

That is the only piece of productivity advice you need.

A good rule of thumb is this:

After 2 weeks, if you haven't made any noticeable progress toward your goals, you are not moving the right levers. You are doing something wrong. Most people won't admit that, or they will intentionally do busy work to avoid making progress, because secretly they want to fail.

That's an even bigger problem.

Your mind notices opportunities to achieve your goals, and many people have an unconscious or deeply programmed goal of staying the same. They want to fail.

So far, our anti-distraction frame is composed of a vision → anti-vision → hierarchy of goals → projects → lever-moving tasks.

This creates a tight feedback loop that encourages more flow states, enjoyment, and progress.

That's the foundation. That's what pushes you deeper into the unknown.

Lastly, how do you actually navigate the highs, lows, emotions, and uncertainty along the way?

## VI – Your potential is determined by the amount of uncertainty you're willing to embrace

Uncertainty is signal, not noise.

You're supposed to feel lost.

You're supposed to feel overwhelmed.

You're supposed to feel like you have no idea what you're doing.

What in the world did you expect to happen when you decided to change your life? Did you just think that all possible knowledge and skill would be deposited into your head the moment you tried to do something?

When you commit to building your own thing, you commit to a life of uncertainty, because you commit to a life of *learning.*

The thing is, the most successful people don't flinch at this. They don't perceive uncertainty as something dangerous, so their fight or flight response doesn't go off. They can trek into the unknown with a clear head, allowing them to make proper decisions.

How?

Because they realized that all outsized gains lie in their ability to *embrace, manage, and extend* uncertainty. They realized that the "certain" life is the least rewarding.

A job is certain. Your paycheck reflects that. A business is uncertain, depending on what level you are operating at. Starting out with a local business, agency work, freelancing, or even information products is level one. It's uncertain, but it's simple, and you have a cap of about $1 to $5 million a year before you need to increase the stakes even further by hiring a team or expanding the business model into something like software or physical products.

The same goes for investing. You can invest your savings in a "certain" 401k. That's level 1. You can invest in the stock market. That's level 2. You can invest in businesses, Bitcoin, or even more uncertain assets. Naturally, those have the highest returns on investment, but also the highest risk.

People are so afraid of making mistakes that they make the biggest mistake of them all, *not making mistakes.*

Imagine a self-driving car.

For years, it has received negative feedback that refines the system that shapes the mind of the car.

It can navigate roads with ease and may be arguably safer than a human driving the car.

Even though we often don't think of it like this, the self-driving car made millions if not billions of mistakes before it could actually reach a meaningful destination.

I wish I could tell you that everyone reading this can just see success the first time they start working toward a goal. But if that were the case, the goal would lose all meaning.

Everything we just did is useful, but I cannot hold your hand throughout the process, nor can anyone else.

You must go through the exact same process as every other successful person.

You must invest in your portfolio of failures until you can afford to succeed.
